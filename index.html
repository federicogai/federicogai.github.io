Federico Gai
known as Fede

"The Italian who learned to think German."

15+ years bridging Italian and German markets — helping brands spend smarter and teams work better.

Let's talk
About me

Two countries,
one perspective.
In 2014 I moved from Italy to Germany — following my German wife, a new life, and a challenge I hadn't fully anticipated: starting over in a language I didn't speak, in an industry I had to reconquer from scratch.

I did. And in doing so, I became something rare in this industry: a media professional who genuinely understands both sides — the Italian warmth and creativity, the German precision and trust. Not as a stereotype, but as a lived experience.

Today I work as a senior leader helping brands navigate their media investment across markets, leading teams and managing client relationships with what I call a simple but non-negotiable philosophy: the Happiness Triangle.

I speak Italian, German and English fluently — and a bit of French when needed.

The Happiness Triangle
My guiding philosophy, developed over 15 years of client work. Any engagement only works long-term if three things are in balance simultaneously.
